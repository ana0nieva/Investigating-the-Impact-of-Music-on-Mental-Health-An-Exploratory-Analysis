# Investigating the Impact of Music on Mental Health: An Exploratory Analysis

# Project Description

Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin. However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset was preprocessed and analyzed to:
- Identify the most prevalent mental health conditions, among Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD 
- Investigate connections between mental health conditions and the most affected demographics
- Examine relationships between demographics, hours of listening to music, and its impact on mental health
- Explore correlations between music genres and the mental health conditions

# File Descriptions
- Music and Mental Health.ipynb: consists of Python scripts used to preprocess the data and to create bar graphs that identify any correlation between each of the four mental health conditions and the music genres
- Tableau: consists of visuals that identify the relationships between: 1) the demographics and the four mental health conditions and 2) the demographics, hours of listening to music, and its impact on mental health
- Google Slides: a compilation of the teams' visuals, along with our observations and conclusions from our exploratory analysis 

# Challenges
- We initially attempted a regression analysis to determine the correlations between the genres and the four mental health conditions, however there was no linear correlation.
- Looking into the column names alone won't be enough for someone to understand what it stands for, along with its values. Throughout the analysis, we have to keep referring back to the detail section on Kaggle for the explanation of the columns.

# Project Outcomes
Below are the conclusions my team came up with from our analysis:
- Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent mental health conditions after this study. It's commonly seen in 10-50 year old individuals.
- Listening to music has been shown to improve mental health, with younger age groups between 10 and 30 years old benefiting the most. There are some 20-30 year olds, however, who claimed that listening to music had no effect on them.
- While there is no set duration for how long one with mental health conditions should listen to music, majority of the responders listen for 3-4 hours a day. At the end, most have claimed that their mental health conditions improved.
- In regards to correlations, we see that 1) listening to Country music very frequently has a high correlation with high anxiety, depression and insomnia levels and 2) listening to Lofi very frequently has a high correlation with high anxiety and depression 

# Next Steps
If this were a work setting we present our findings to intended stakeholders-- Social Workers and Mental Health Counselors, my team and I recommend the following: 
- When encouraging music therapy to their patients, the patients should to listen to music for about 3-4 hours per day, regardless of their mental health condition.
- As to which genres to recommend, stakeholders should try to gauge to your patientsâ€™ music preferences, then from there, recommend which genre(s) would be more or less helpful to their mental health condition.
